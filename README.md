## About The Project
Simple clone of windows calculator using C++ and WinUI3 for learning reasons. I was aiming to get a similliar look and functionatity of the simple windows calculator minus the weird m operators things(whatever thoses are for, never used them in my life). It currently has all base math operation as the win calc,except % and +/- operators(because I`m a lazy bum and want to move on).
Current Look:

- Yeah thats about it

## Learnings
- Project was good to get back into the basics of the C++ syntax 
- First experience with mark up language like xaml (did like 5 minutes of html before this)
- Need to seperate the frontend functionality (visual stuff) from the backend functionality (calculating stuff)
- Even simple application have some complexity to them
